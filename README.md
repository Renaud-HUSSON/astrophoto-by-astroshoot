# Astrophoto by AstroShoot

Astrophoto by AstroShoot si a website I'm rebuilding for a friend, which permits him to upload his astrophotography content

## Technologies I'm using

* Frontend:

I'm using React as javascript framework (I'm new to this that's my first project with React)

* Backend:

I'm using PHP with a REST API, and MySQL as DBMS
